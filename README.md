# Analysis and Prediction System for Potato Crops in Peru

## üìã Overview
This project implements a comprehensive system for the analysis and prediction of potato crops in Peru, integrating geospatial, climatic, and agricultural data. The system uses deep learning models and time series analysis to forecast yields and demand for various potato varieties.
